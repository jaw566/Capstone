    <h2 class="text-center">Problem Statment</h2>
    <p>The barrier of entry to the field of autonomous driving is steep. The hardware needed to get started is expensive
      and most of the time requires the user to wire and solder all the components together. The F1/10 platform was made
      to be a cheap, scaled-down version of a Formula 1 car but still cost upwards of $3,000. For entry-level autonomy,
      many open source projects work but require an extensive background in coding and Linux. Almost all of the said
      solutions use ROS to control the robot and handle all sensors.</p>
    <p>ROS is one of the main hurdles when learning robotics. It is the most used robotic framework in industries across
      the world. ROS was created to be a global collaboration to make the field of robotics more accessible. Its modular
      design allows users to choose packages that will be useful to them and implement their solutions. To use ROS,
      everything is done through a command-line interface. On top of knowing all of ROS's commands users need to be
      comfortable with Linux commands.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center mt-5">Solution Overview</h2>
    <p>We envision a solution that meets our clients needs by transitioning the current workflow to a highly
      interactable graphical user interface (GUI) that lowers the barrier of entry to use ROS. The GUI will remove
      any need for the students to use the command line and will only allow students to make valid configurations for
      the RC car. By abstracting away complexities involved in utilizing ROS to make a vehicle run, students will be
      able to instead focus on ascertaining an effective and enjoyable learning experience. Additionally, we will have a
      communication toolkit that enables a kill switch mechanism for the car. This will ensure the safety of every
      student involved and the safety of our clientâ€™s very expensive product; the vehicle itself. Key highlights of our
      software include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Communication Tool Kit</li>
      <li>Configuration System</li>
      <li>Implicit File Organization</li>
      <li>Profiler</li>
      <li>Console</li>
    </ul>
